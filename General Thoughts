> Please write a short description of why you find your data source interesting. Turn this in on canvas by class time on Thursday, week 10. 

We were looking into different types of public funding in Wisconsin and came across the library data set. Public libraries are interesting since they provide education, community programs, and access to technology and wifi. We are curious as to how the funding and resource allocation/utilization of each library correlate with the community surrounding them.

A common issue with public funding is that it is higher in rich, white, and advantaged areas. We are curious if this pattern exists in libraries and how the type of resource utilization changes depending on the community (i.e. if lower-income areas where people may not have access to wifi at home increases computer utilization at public libraries).

This dataset contains lots of information about libraries that we can use to compare the funding and resource allocation/utilization of public libraries in Wisconsin and by comparing the library data with county demographic data we should be able to find correlations between the libraries and the communities surrounding them.
